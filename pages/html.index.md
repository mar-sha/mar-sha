## About Me

### **Hi there, Marsha here**

An **_Industrial Engineering_** graduate with professional experience in quality control,
specifically in the logistics industry and facilities design. Familiar with
CRM development, work performance, system, and design analysis, and logistics
terms.

I am also self-aware of myself and this quality results in the tendency to always be
critical as to why things happen and how can we make things better, especially for
things with **_positive causes_**.
